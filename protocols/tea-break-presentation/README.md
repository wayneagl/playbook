# Tea Break Presentation
Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, one coder will do a Ruby presentation during the tea break (320PM to 340PM). All coders are expected to attend the presentation.

The presentation is around 10-20 mins and coders are free to present anything as long as it is useful information (though most would choose Ruby on Rails topics).

We use a Google spreadsheet to queue every coder so that they know when it is their turn to present. After your presentation, please inform HR your presentation topic for tracking purposes.

Newly hired coders in probation are exempted from doing a presentation. They are still required to attend the presentation. However, once they are confirmed, they will be placed in queue to do presentation.
